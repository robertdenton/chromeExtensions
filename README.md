<h1>Chrome extension to simplify news</h1>

The web is <a href="http://www.denverpost.com">messy</a>. I wanted to make a Chrome extension to clean it up a bit.

My first efforts (in the scratch folder) are my poking fun at Digital First Media's recent web redesign and specifically the Boulder Daily Camera because, well, I like to occasionally poke fun at the Camera.

Now, for the record, Digital First is doing some really cool stuff (<a href="http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/project_unbolt/">Project Unbolt</a>) and I respect John Paton's push into the the digital future very much. Also, the Daily Camera does some amazing reporting on Boulder and CU.

So, again, for the record, this is nothing but playful jabbing, not a serious critique.

Anyway, the extension gets rid of most of the visual elements, ads and converts most of the text to Comic Sans. Right now it is only functional with the Daily Camera and Denver Post sites (as of 2/19/14).

To try the extension out for yourself, download the whole "scratch" folder and go to Chrome's Tools > Extensions. Make sure "Developer Mode" is checked and then click "Load Unpacked Extension". This will open up a file browser and all you need to do is select the "scratch" folder from your downloads folder and you should be good to go. To turn the extension off, simply disable it in the Tools > Extensions menu.

Enjoy!

And feel free to edit, change, distribute or do whatever you want with the code.
